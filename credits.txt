clipper.iff

        EHB image by Rick Parks

enterprise.iff

        Picture from disk one of the "Star Trek" game by Tobias Richter (1989).
        The game is also available on Fish Disk 409.

fashion.iff

        HAM demo picture for the NewTek "Digi-Paint" painting program.
        An iconic picture, due to being prominently used
        in NewTek advertising.

glass.iff

        DBW-Render ray-traced glass scene (1988).
        This image was somewhat iconic on the Amiga,
        probably due to its presence on Fish Disk. An impressive
        demonstration of Amiga HAM mode.
        Probably rendered on a VAX like the other pictures by Dave Wecker.

        From Fish Disk 44:

        RayTracePics	Ray tracing pictures, some of which appeared on disk
		        number 39, but now in IFF HAM format for MUCH faster
		        loading and compatibility with existing IFF tools.

king_tut.iff

        DeluxePaint I/II/III demo picture
        Was also used on the DeluxePaint cover and in advertising and came to
        symbolize DeluxePaint and the Amiga.

next_gen.iff

        Star Trek: The Next Generation picture created by "Park".
        Probably created in 1987 or 1988, as Tasha Yar was not long
        for this world.

porsche930.iff

        An impressive HAM overscan + interlaced image, created with
        some seriously professional scanning hardware for the time.

        From Fish Disk 196:

        HamPics		These are some of the most stunning digitized pictures
		        yet for the Amiga.  They were scanned at a resolution
		        of 4096 by 2800 pixels, 36-bits per pixel, on an
		        Eikonix 1435 slide scanner, cropped, gamma corrected,
		        scaled, and converted to Amiga IFF HAM files.  They are
		        displayed with a special ILBM loader that handles
		        overscan HAM images.  Includes source for the display
		        program.

room.iff

        Ray-traced picture by Dave Wecker (1988) from Fish Disk 44 (and 39),
        like glass.iff.
        Took 3 hours and 28 minutes to render on a VAX-8650 according
        to the README on Fish Disk 39.

spock.iff

        Star Trek picture created by "Park".
        McCoy's quote is based on the episode "The Ultimate Computer",
        but it appears Spock now prefers an Amiga 1000 over the M-5 computer.

starflight.iff

        DeluxePaint demo picture from the EA game "Starflight" (1986),
        created by Greg Johnson in 1985.
        Apparently the design of the alien bridge is based on a concept sketch
        by Ron Cobb for the 1979 film "Alien".

stone_circle.lbm

        Image by Mark J. Ferrari in IFF-PBM format
        Created on a PC with DeluxePaint II

tng.iff

        DeluxePaint V HAM8 conversion of a BluRay screenshot from trekcore.com
        from the ST:TNG episode "The Arsenal of Freedom".

tos.iff

        DeluxePaint V HAM8 conversion of a BluRay screenshot from trekcore.com
        from the Star Trek episode "Miri".

tracer.iff

        Ray traced picture by the "Tracer" software, early 1990s. While the
        image is 24-bit, only the upper nibbles are used, so it is effectively
        a 12-bit image. So basically HAM without the HAM artifacts.
        The spheres look squashed vertically, which was probably due to a
        mistake in the Tracer image settings.

worldmap.iff

        DeluxePaint IV demo picture.
        This image was used to show the 3-D functions of DPaint IV,
        by stretching it around a sphere as a texture.
